	abstract = {Recent advancements in technology and methodology have led to growing amounts of increasingly complex neuroscience data recorded from various species, modalities, and levels of study. The rapid data growth has made efficient data access and flexible, machine-readable data annotation a crucial requisite for neuroscientists. Clear and consistent annotation and organization of data is not only an important ingredient for reproducibility of results and re-use of data, but also essential for collaborative research and data sharing. In particular, efficient data management and interoperability requires a unified approach that integrates data and metadata and provides a common way of accessing this information. In this paper we describe {GNData}, a data management platform for neurophysiological data. {GNData} provides a storage system based on a data representation that is suitable to organize data and metadata from any electrophysiological experiment, with a functionality exposed via a common application programming interface ({API).} Data representation and {API} structure are compatible with existing approaches for data and metadata representation in neurophysiology. The {API} implementation is based on the Representational State Transfer ({REST)} pattern, which enables data access integration in software applications and facilitates the development of tools that communicate with the service. Client libraries that interact with the {API} provide direct data access from computing environments like Matlab or Python, enabling integration of data management into the scientist's experimental or analysis routines.},

	abstract = {Structured, efficient, and secure storage of experimental data and associated meta-information constitutes one of the most pressing technical challenges in modern neuroscience, and does so particularly in electrophysiology. The German {INCF} Node aims to provide open-source solutions for this domain that support the scientific data management and analysis workflow, and thus facilitate future data access and reproducible research. G-Node provides a data management system, accessible through an application interface, that is based on a combination of standardized data representation and flexible data annotation to account for the variety of experimental paradigms in electrophysiology. The G-Node Python Library exposes these services to the Python environment, enabling researchers to organize and access their experimental data using their familiar tools while gaining the advantages that a centralized storage entails. The library provides powerful query features, including data slicing and selection by metadata, as well as fine-grained permission control for collaboration and data sharing. Here we demonstrate key actions in working with experimental neuroscience data, such as building a metadata structure, organizing recorded data in datasets, annotating data, or selecting data regions of interest, that can be automated to large degree using the library. Compliant with existing de-facto standards, the G-Node Python Library is compatible with many Python tools in the field of neurophysiology and thus enables seamless integration of data organization into the scientific data workflow.},

abstract = {For the past 40 years, the techniques, processes and methods of software development have been dominated by supply-side issues, giving rise to a software industry oriented towards developers rather than users. To achieve the levels of functionality, flexibility and time to market required by users, a radical shift is required in the development of software, with a more demand-centric view leading to software which will be delivered as a service within the framework of an open marketplace. Already, there are some signs that this approach is being adopted by industry but in a very limited way. We summarise research and a research method which has resulted in a long-term strategic view of software engineering innovation. Based on this foundation, we describe more recent work, which has resulted in an innovative demand-side model for the future of software. We propose a service architecture in which components may be bound instantly, just at the time they are needed -- and then the binding may be
discarded. A major benefit of this approach is that it leads to highly flexible and agile software, that should be able to meet rapidly changing business needs. 1.},

For a systematic approach to understanding neuronal mechanisms, it is important to integrate research results from various fields, such as morphology, physiology and immunohistochemistry. We are developing a database system, the Bombyx Neuron Database (BoND) for assembling and sharing experimental and analytical data. The system is designed and developed based on experimental data, mostly obtained from intracellular recordings. A new WWW technology, CMS (Content Management System), was implemented in our system. That is, PHP-based CMS, XOOPS, provides several functions for web-based database management, for instance, user accounting, web page designing and data backup. The BoND was developed by our original database module of XOOPS, in order to deal with electrophysiological and anatomical data. Research resources from various fields are combined in the database for realizing a conjunction of experiments and analysis, which will assist progress in understanding neural network mechanisms as a virtual laboratory.},

So-called service-oriented architectures define standard interfaces and protocols that allow developers to encapsulate information tools as services that clients can access without knowledge of, or control over, their internal workings. Thus, tools formerly accessible only to the specialist can be made available to all; previously manual data-processing and analysis tasks can be automated by having services access services. Such service-oriented approaches to science are already being applied successfully, in some cases at substantial scales, but much more effort is required before these approaches are applied routinely across many disciplines. Grid technologies can accelerate the development and adoption of service-oriented science by enabling a separation of concerns between discipline-specific content and domain-independent software and hardware infrastructure.},

The exchange of neuroscience data and tools between groups affords the opportunity to differently re-analyze previously collected data, encourage new neuroscience interpretations and foster otherwise uninitiated collaborations, and provide a framework for the further development of theoretically based models of brain function. Data sharing will ultimately reduce experimental and analytical error. Many small Internet accessible database initiatives have been developed and specialized analytical software and modeling tools are distributed within different fields of neuroscience. However, in addition large-scale international collaborations are required which involve new mechanisms of coordination and funding. Provided sufficient government support is given to such international initiatives, sharing of neuroscience data and tools can play a pivotal role in human brain research and lead to innovations in neuroscience, informatics and treatment of brain disorders. These innovations will enable application of theoretical modeling techniques to enhance our understanding of the integrative aspects of neuroscience.

abstract = {Tracing the centerline of the dendritic arbor of neurons is a powerful technique for analyzing neuronal morphology. In the various neuron tracing algorithms in use nowadays, the competing goals of computational efficiency and robustness are generally traded off against each other. We present a novel method for tracing the centerline of a neuron from confocal image stacks, which provides an optimal balance between these objectives. Using only local information, thin cross-sectional layers of voxels ('scoops') are iteratively carved out of the structure, and clustered based on connectivity. Each cluster contributes a node along the centerline, which is created by connecting successive nodes until all object voxels are exhausted. While data segmentation is independent of this algorithm, we illustrate the use of the ISODATA method to achieve dynamic (local) segmentation. Diameter estimation at each node is calculated using the Rayburst Sampling algorithm, and spurious end nodes caused by surface irregularities are then removed. On standard computing hardware the algorithm can process hundreds of thousands of voxels per second, easily handling the multi-gigabyte datasets resulting from high-resolution confocal microscopy imaging of neurons. This method provides an accurate and efficient means for centerline extraction that is suitable for interactive neuron tracing applications.},

abstract = {We investigated the effect of morphological differences on neuronal firing behavior within the hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cell family by using three-dimensional reconstructions of dendritic morphology in computational simulations of electrophysiology. In this paper, we report for the first time that differences in dendritic structure within the same morphological class can have a dramatic influence on the firing rate and firing mode (spiking versus bursting and type of bursting). Our method consisted of converting morphological measurements from three-dimensional neuroanatomical data of CA3 pyramidal cells into a computational simulator format. In the simulation, active channels were distributed evenly across the cells so that the electrophysiological differences observed in the neurons would only be due to morphological differences. We found that differences in the size of the dendritic tree of CA3 pyramidal cells had a significant qualitative and quantitative effect on the electrophysiological response. Cells with larger dendritic trees: (1) had a lower burst rate, but a higher spike rate within a burst, (2) had higher thresholds for transitions from quiescent to bursting and from bursting to regular spiking and (3) tended to burst with a plateau. Dendritic tree size alone did not account for all the differences in electrophysiological responses. Differences in apical branching, such as the distribution of branch points and terminations per branch order, appear to effect the duration of a burst. These results highlight the importance of considering the contribution of morphology in electrophysiological and simulation studies.},

abstract = {Honeybees detect airborne vibration by means of Johnston's organ (JO), located in the pedicel of each antenna. In this study we identified two types of vibration-sensitive interneurons with arborizations in the primary sensory area of the JO, namely, the dorsal lobe-interneuron 1 (DL-Int-1) and dorsal lobe-interneuron 2 (DL-Int-2) using intracellular recordings combined with intracellular staining. For visualizing overlapping areas between the JO sensory terminals and the branches of these identified interneurons, the three-dimensional images of the individual neurons were registered into the standard atlas of the honeybee brain (Brandt et al. [2005] J Comp Neurol 492:1-19). Both DL-Int-1 and DL-Int-2 overlapped with the central terminal area of receptor neurons of the JO in the DL. For DL-Int-1 an on-off phasic excitation was elicited by vibrational stimuli applied to the JO when the spontaneous spike frequency was low, whereas tonic inhibition was induced when it was high. Moreover, current injection into a DL-Int-1 led to changes of the response pattern from on-off phasic excitation to tonic inhibition, in response to the vibratory stimulation. Although the vibration usually induced on-off phasic excitation in DL-Int-1, vibration applied immediately after odor stimulation induced tonic inhibition in it. DL-Int-2 responded to vibration stimuli applied to the JO by a tonic burst and were most sensitive to 265 Hz vibration, which is coincident with the strongest frequency of airborne vibrations arising during the waggle dance. These results suggest that DL-Int-1 and DL-Int-2 are related to coding of the duration of the vibration as sensed by the JO.},

abstract = {This paper presents a broadly applicable algorithm and a comprehensive open-source software implementation for automated tracing of neuronal structures in 3-D microscopy images. The core 3-D neuron tracing algorithm is based on three-dimensional (3-D) open-curve active Contour (Snake). It is initiated from a set of automatically detected seed points. Its evolution is driven by a combination of deforming forces based on the Gradient Vector Flow (GVF), stretching forces based on estimation of the fiber orientations, and a set of control rules. In this tracing model, bifurcation points are detected implicitly as points where multiple snakes collide. A boundariness measure is employed to allow local radius estimation. A suite of pre-processing algorithms enable the system to accommodate diverse neuronal image datasets by reducing them to a common image format. The above algorithms form the basis for a comprehensive, scalable, and efficient software system developed for confocal or brightfield images. It provides multiple automated tracing modes. The user can optionally interact with the tracing system using multiple view visualization, and exercise full control to ensure a high quality reconstruction. We illustrate the utility of this tracing system by presenting results from a synthetic dataset, a brightfield dataset and two confocal datasets from the DIADEM challenge.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For the investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in neurite outgrowth and differentiation, accurate and reproducible segmentation and quantification of neuronal processes are a prerequisite. To facilitate this task, we developed a semiautomatic neurite tracing technique. This article describes the design and validation of the technique. METHODS: The technique was compared to fully manual delineation. Four observers repeatedly traced selected neurites in 20 fluorescence microscopy images of cells in culture, using both methods. Accuracy and reproducibility were determined by comparing the tracings to high-resolution reference tracings, using two error measures. Labor intensiveness was measured in numbers of mouse clicks required. The significance of the results was determined by a Student t-test and by analysis of variance. RESULTS: Both methods slightly underestimated the true neurite length, but the differences were not unanimously significant. The average deviation from the true neurite centerline was a factor 2.6 smaller with the developed technique compared to fully manual tracing. Intraobserver variability in the respective measures was reduced by a factor 6.0 and 23.2. Interobserver variability was reduced by a factor 2.4 and 8.8, respectively, and labor intensiveness by a factor 3.3. CONCLUSIONS: Providing similar accuracy in measuring neurite length, significantly improved accuracy in neurite centerline extraction, and significantly improved reproducibility and reduced labor intensiveness, the developed technique may replace fully manual tracing methods.},

@article{Brandt2005,
abstract = {The anatomical substrates of neural nets are usually composed from reconstructions of neurons that were stained in different preparations. Realistic models of the structural relationships between neurons require a common framework. Here we present 3-D reconstructions of single projection neurons (PN) connecting the antennal lobe (AL) with the mushroom body (MB) and lateral horn, groups of intrinsic mushroom body neurons (type 5 Kenyon cells), and a single mushroom body extrinsic neuron (PE1), aiming to compose components of the olfactory pathway in the honeybee. To do so, we constructed a digital standard atlas of the bee brain. The standard atlas was created as an average-shape atlas of 22 neuropils, calculated from 20 individual immunostained whole-mount bee brains. After correction for global size and positioning differences by repeatedly applying an intensity-based nonrigid registration algorithm, a sequence of average label images was created. The results were qualitatively evaluated by generating average gray-value images corresponding to the average label images and judging the level of detail within the labeled regions. We found that the first affine registration step in the sequence results in a blurred image because of considerable local shape differences. However, already the first nonrigid iteration in the sequence corrected for most of the shape differences among individuals, resulting in images rich in internal detail. A second iteration improved on that somewhat and was selected as the standard. Registering neurons from different preparations into the standard atlas reveals 1) that the m-ACT neuron occupies the entire glomerulus (cortex and core) and overlaps with a local interneuron in the cortical layer; 2) that, in the MB calyces and the lateral horn of the protocerebral lobe, the axon terminals of two identified m-ACT neurons arborize in separate but close areas of the neuropil; and 3) that MB-intrinsic clawed Kenyon cells (type 5), with somata outside the calycal cups, project to the peduncle and lobe output system of the MB and contact (proximate) the dendritic tree of the PE1 neuron at the base of the vertical lobe. Thus the standard atlas and the procedures applied for registration serve the function of creating realistic neuroanatomical models of parts of a neural net.

@article{Al-Kofahi2003,
abstract = {This paper presents a method to exploit rank statistics to improve fully automatic tracing of neurons from noisy digital confocal microscope images. Previously proposed exploratory tracing (vectorization) algorithms work by recursively following the neuronal topology, guided by responses of multiple directional correlation kernels. These algorithms were found to fail when the data was of lower quality (noisier, less contrast, weak signal, or more discontinuous structures). This type of data is commonly encountered in the study of neuronal growth on microfabricated surfaces. We show that by partitioning the correlation kernels in the tracing algorithm into multiple subkernels, and using the median of their responses as the guiding criterion improves the tracing precision from 41\% to 89\% for low-quality data, with a 5\% improvement in recall. Improved handling was observed for artifacts such as discontinuities and/or hollowness of structures. The new algorithms require slightly higher amounts of computation, but are still acceptably fast, typically consuming less than 2 seconds on a personal computer (Pentium III, 500 MHz, 128 MB). They produce labeling for all somas present in the field, and a graph-theoretic representation of all dendritic/axonal structures that can be edited. Topological and size measurements such as area, length, and tortuosity are derived readily. The efficiency, accuracy, and fully-automated nature of the proposed method makes it attractive for large-scale applications such as high-throughput assays in the pharmaceutical industry, and study of neuron growth on nano/micro-fabricated structures. A careful quantitative validation of the proposed algorithms is provided against manually derived tracing, using a performance measure that combines the precision and recall metrics.},

abstract = {The waggle dancers of honeybees encodes roughly the distance and direction to the food source as the duration of the waggle phase and the body angle during the waggle phase. It is believed that hive-mates detect airborne vibrations produced during the waggle phase to acquire distance information and simultaneously detect the body axis during the waggle phase to acquire direction information. It has been further proposed that the orientation of the body axis on the vertical comb is detected by neck hairs (NHs) on the prosternal organ. The afferents of the NHs project into the prothoracic and mesothoracic ganglia and the dorsal subesophageal ganglion (dSEG). This study demonstrates somatotopic organization within the dSEG of the central projections of the mechanosensory neurons of the NHs. The terminals of the NH afferents in dSEG are in close apposition to those of Johnston's organ (JO) afferents. The sensory axons of both terminate in a region posterior to the crossing of the ventral intermediate tract (VIT) and the maxillary dorsal commissures I and III (MxDCI, III) in the subesophageal ganglion. These features of the terminal areas of the NH and JO afferents are common to the worker, drone, and queen castes of honeybees. Analysis of the spatial relationship between the NH neurons and the morphologically and physiologically characterized vibration-sensitive interneurons DL-Int-1 and DL-Int-2 demonstrated that several branches of DL-Int-1 are in close proximity to the central projection of the mechanosensory neurons of the NHs in the dSEG.},

abstract = {Johnston's organ (JO) in insects is a multicellular mechanosensory organ stimulated by movement of the distal part of the antenna. In honeybees JO is thought to be a primary sensor detecting air-particle movements caused by the waggling dance of conspecifics. In this study projection patterns of JO afferents within the brain were investigated. About 720 somata, distributed around the periphery of the second segment of the antenna (pedicel), were divided into three subgroups based on their soma location: an anterior group, a ventral group, and a dorsal group. These groups sent axons to different branches (N2 to N4) diverged from the antennal nerve. Dye injection into individual nerve branches revealed that all three groups of afferents, having fine collaterals in the dorsal lobe, sent axons broadly through tracts T6I, T6II, and T6III to terminate ipsilaterally in the medial posterior protocerebral lobe, the dorsal region of the subesophageal ganglion, and the central posterior protocerebral lobe, respectively. Within these termination fields only axon terminals running in T6I were characterized by thick processes with large varicosities. Differential staining using fluorescent dyes revealed that the axon terminals of the three groups were spatially segregated, especially in T6I, showing some degree of somatotopy. This spatial segregation was not observed in axon terminals running in other tracts. Our results show that projection patterns of JO afferents in the honeybee brain fundamentally resemble those in the dipteran brain. The possible roles of extensive termination fields of JO afferents in parallel processings of mechanosensory signals are discussed.},

abstract = {The overarching goal of the NIF (Neuroscience Information Framework) project is to be a one-stop-shop for Neuroscience. This paper provides a technical overview of how the system is designed. The technical goal of the first version of the NIF system was to develop an information system that a neuroscientist can use to locate relevant information from a wide variety of information sources by simple keyword queries. Although the user would provide only keywords to retrieve information, the NIF system is designed to treat them as concepts whose meanings are interpreted by the system. Thus, a search for term should find a record containing synonyms of the term. The system is targeted to find information from web pages, publications, databases, web sites built upon databases, XML documents and any other modality in which such information may be published. We have designed a system to achieve this functionality. A central element in the system is an ontology called NIFSTD (for NIF Standard) constructed by amalgamating a number of known and newly developed ontologies. NIFSTD is used by our ontology management module, called OntoQuest to perform ontology-based search over data sources. The NIF architecture currently provides three different mechanisms for searching heterogeneous data sources including relational databases, web sites, XML documents and full text of publications. Version 1.0 of the NIF system is currently in beta test and may be accessed through http://nif.nih.gov.},

abstract = {Large datasets are becoming more and more common in science, particularly in neuroscience where experimental techniques are rapidly evolving. Obtaining interpretable results from raw data can sometimes be done automatically; however, there are numerous situations where there is a need, at all processing stages, to visualize the data in an interactive way. This enables the scientist to gain intuition, discover unexpected patterns, and find guidance about subsequent analysis steps. Existing visualization tools mostly focus on static publication-quality figures and do not support interactive visualization of large datasets. While working on Python software for visualization of neurophysiological data, we developed techniques to leverage the computational power of modern graphics cards for high-performance interactive data visualization. We were able to achieve very high performance despite the interpreted and dynamic nature of Python, by using state-of-the-art, fast libraries such as NumPy, PyOpenGL and PyTables. We present applications of these methods to visualization of neurophysiological data. We believe our tools will be useful in a broad range of domains, in neuroscience and beyond, where there is an increasing need for scalable and fast interactive visualization.},

abstract = {Metadata providing information about the stimulus, data acquisition, and experimental conditions are indispensable for the analysis and management of experimental data within a lab. However, only rarely are metadata available in a structured, comprehensive, and machine-readable form. This poses a severe problem for finding and retrieving data, both in the laboratory and on the various emerging public data bases. Here, we propose a simple format, the "open metaData Markup Language" (odML), for collecting and exchanging metadata in an automated, computer-based fashion. In odML arbitrary metadata information is stored as extended key-value pairs in a hierarchical structure. Central to odML is a clear separation of format and content, i.e., neither keys nor values are defined by the format. This makes odML flexible enough for storing all available metadata instantly without the necessity to submit new keys to an ontology or controlled terminology. Common standard keys can be defined in odML-terminologies for guaranteeing interoperability. We started to define such terminologies for neurophysiological data, but aim at a community driven extension and refinement of the proposed definitions. By customized terminologies that map to these standard terminologies, metadata can be named and organized as required or preferred without softening the standard. Together with the respective libraries provided for common programming languages, the odML format can be integrated into the laboratory workflow, facilitating automated collection of metadata information where it becomes available. The flexibility of odML also encourages a community driven collection and definition of terms used for annotating data in the neurosciences.},

abstract="OBJECTIVE: Generalizing the data models underlying two prototype neurophysiology databases, the authors describe and propose the Common Data Model (CDM) as a framework for federating a broad spectrum of disparate neuroscience information resources. DESIGN: Each component of the CDM derives from one of five superclasses-data, site, method, model, and reference-or from relations defined between them. A hierarchic attribute-value scheme for metadata enables interoperability with variable tree depth to serve specific intra- or broad inter-domain queries. To mediate data exchange between disparate systems, the authors propose a set of XML-derived schema for describing not only data sets but data models. These include biophysical description markup language (BDML), which mediates interoperability between data resources by providing a meta-description for the CDM. RESULTS: The set of superclasses potentially spans data needs of contemporary neuroscience. Data elements abstracted from neurophysiology time series and histogram data represent data sets that differ in dimension and concordance. Site elements transcend neurons to describe subcellular compartments, circuits, regions, or slices; non-neuroanatomic sites include sequences to patients. Methods and models are highly domain-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: True federation of data resources requires explicit public description, in a metalanguage, of the contents, query methods, data formats, and data models of each data resource. Any data model that can be derived from the defined superclasses is potentially conformant and interoperability can be enabled by recognition of BDML-described compatibilities. Such metadescriptions can buffer technologic changes.",

abstract="We have implemented a pair of database projects, one serving cortical electrophysiology and the other invertebrate neurones and recordings. The design for each combines aspects of two proven schemes for information interchange. The journal article metaphor determined the type, scope, organization and quantity of data to comprise each submission. Sequence databases encouraged intuitive tools for data viewing, capture, and direct submission by authors. Neurophysiology required transcending these models with new datatypes. Time-series, histogram and bivariate datatypes, including illustration-like wrappers, were selected by their utility to the community of investigators. As interpretation of neurophysiological recordings depends on context supplied by metadata attributes, searches are via visual interfaces to sets of controlled-vocabulary metadata trees. Neurones, for example, can be specified by metadata describing functional and anatomical characteristics. Permanence is advanced by data model and data formats largely independent of contemporary technology or implementation, including Java and the XML standard. All user tools, including dynamic data viewers that serve as a virtual oscilloscope, are Java-based, free, multiplatform, and distributed by our application servers to any contemporary networked computer.

abstract="Computational neuroscience is a subfield of neuroscience that develops models to integrate complex experimental data in order to understand brain function. To constrain and test computational models, researchers need access to a wide variety of experimental data. Much of those data are not readily accessible because neuroscientists fall into separate communities that study the brain at different levels and have not been motivated to provide data to researchers outside their community. To foster sharing of neuroscience data, a workshop was held in 2007, bringing together experimental and theoretical neuroscientists, computer scientists, legal experts and governmental observers. Computational neuroscience was recommended as an ideal field for focusing data sharing, and specific methods, strategies and policies were suggested for achieving it. A new funding area in the NSF/NIH Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program has been established to support data sharing, guided in part by the workshop recommendations. The new funding area is dedicated to the dissemination of high quality data sets with maximum scientific value for computational neuroscience. The first round of the CRCNS data sharing program supports the preparation of data sets which will be publicly available in 2008. These include electrophysiology and behavioral (eye movement) data described towards the end of this article.",
